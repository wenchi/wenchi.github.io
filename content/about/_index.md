Hello! I’m Ken Chang, an iOS mobile engineer since 2013.

Over the years, I’ve developed apps in areas like e-commerce, community building, price comparison, cashback rewards, and ride-hailing.

This blog is a collection of my development journey, technical insights, and ideas. I hope you find something valuable and inspiring here!
